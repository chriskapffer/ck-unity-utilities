# ck-unity-utilities
A set of common tools used by most of my other unity repositories

Have look at the example scene to see some of them in action. Others are used by the [mobile plugins](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-mobile).

Currently the collection consists of
* A [singleton/multiton](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/Singleton.cs) - you know what it is and you know it's controversial
* A [screen logger](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/ScreenLog.cs) - prints stuff on the screen instead of the console (this is a great example for singleton usage)
* A [frame counter](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/FrameCounter.cs) and a [memory watcher](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/MemoryWatcher.cs). These are things you might want to print to your screen ;)
* Two behaviours to set up input handling from within the editor. Have a look at [`InputCondition.cs`](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/InputCondition.cs) and [`InputActionTrigger.cs`](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/InputActionTrigger.cs) for more explanations.
* Three editor attributes. These are:
 - A [button attribute](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/Attributes/ButtonAttribute.cs) which instead of a variable show a button in the inspector. You can specify a member function which will be executed upon button press.
 - A [disabled attribute](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/Attributes/DisabledAttribute.cs) which shows a field and its value but without being able to change it in the inspector. Useful to monitor private fields in the inspector without exposing them in the code.
 - A ["on change" atttribute](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/Attributes/OnChangeAttribute.cs) which invokes a member function when the value of its associated field changes. That way you can execute property setters when changing stuff in the inspector. Yay!
* A class to [detect if the app is running on OSX](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/OSXDetector.cs). This might sound boring, but wait until you want to use the system's modifier keys in webGL (there is no such thing as `RuntimePlatform.OSXWebGL`).
* A class that enables you to use Coroutines without the need of being inside a MonoBehaviour. I named it [`StaticCoroutine`](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/StaticCoroutine.cs).
* A [thread helper](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-utilities/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Utilities/Scripts/ThreadHelper.cs) which can invoke an action delegate on another thread. It also allows you to set up a delegate from within another thread to be invoked on the main thread again. This is used in the [NativePopup module](https://github.com/chriskapffer/ck-unity-mobile/blob/master/Assets/chriskapffer/Modules/Mobile/Scripts/NativePopup.cs). When the popup closes the native plugins invoke a callback, so we are back in Mono, while still being on the ui-thread of the system (which is not the thread Unity lives in).
